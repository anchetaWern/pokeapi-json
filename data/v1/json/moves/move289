Moves which may be stolen by this move are identified by the \"snatchable\" flag.\n\nIf two Pokémon use this move on the same turn, the faster Pokémon will steal the first beneficial move, and the slower Pokémon will then steal it again—thus, only the slowest Pokémon using this move ultimately gains a stolen move's effect.\n\nIf the user steals psych-up, it will target the Pokémon that used psych-up.  If the user was the original target of psych-up, and the Pokémon that originally used it's affected by pressure, it will only lose 1 PP.\n\nThis move cannot be copied by mirror-move, nor selected by assist or metronome.", "id": 289, "modified": "2013-12-24T15:24:31.360805", "name": "Snatch", "power": 0, "pp": 10, "resource_uri": "/api/v1/move/289/"}
